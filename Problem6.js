/*"If you hurriedly leave for school but encounter a red traffic signal, it might be dangerous to attempt crossing. In such a situation, if you try to cross the road, there is a risk. If the signal is yellow, you should wait. And if the traffic signal is green, then it is safe for you to cross. So, write a code where we have a variable named 'signal,' which can have values like green, yellow, or red. Based on its value, different actions will be executed. Write the code promptly."
